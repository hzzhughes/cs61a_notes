# Homework 2: Higher-Order Functions hw02.zip
Due by 11:59pm on Tuesday, June 30

## Instructions
Download hw02.zip. Inside the archive, you will find a file called hw02.py, along with a copy of the ok autograder.

**Submission:** When you are done, submit with `python3 ok --submit`. You may submit more than once before the deadline; only the final submission will be scored. Check that you have successfully submitted your code on okpy.org. See Lab 0 for more instructions on submitting assignments.

**Using Ok:** If you have any questions about using Ok, please refer to this guide.

**Readings:** You might find the following references useful:

- Section 1.6

**Grading:** Homework is graded based on correctness. Each incorrect problem will decrease the total score by one point. There is a homework recovery policy as stated in the syllabus. This homework is out of 3 points.

The construct_check module is used in this assignment, which defines the function check. For example, a call such as
```python
check("foo.py", "func1", ["While", "For", "Recursion"])
```
checks that the function func1 in file foo.py does not contain any while or for constructs, and is not an overtly recursive function (i.e., one in which a function contains a call to itself by name.) Note that this restriction does not apply to all problems in this assignment. If this restriction applies, you will see a call to check somewhere in the problem's doctests.

## Required questions
Several doctests refer to these functions:
```python
from operator import add, mul, sub

square = lambda x: x * x

identity = lambda x: x

triple = lambda x: 3 * x
```
increment = lambda x: x + 1
### Q1: Product
The `summation(n, term)` function from the higher-order functions lecture adds up `term(1) + ... + term(n)`. Write a similar function called product that returns `term(1) * ... * term(n)`.
```python
def product(n, term):
    """Return the product of the first n terms in a sequence.
    n -- a positive integer
    term -- a function that takes one argument to produce the term

    >>> product(3, identity)  # 1 * 2 * 3
    6
    >>> product(5, identity)  # 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5
    120
    >>> product(3, square)    # 1^2 * 2^2 * 3^2
    36
    >>> product(5, square)    # 1^2 * 2^2 * 3^2 * 4^2 * 5^2
    14400
    >>> product(3, increment) # (1+1) * (2+1) * (3+1)
    24
    >>> product(3, triple)    # 1*3 * 2*3 * 3*3
    162
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```
Use Ok to test your code:
```
python3 ok -q product
```
### Q2: Accumulate
Let's take a look at how `summation` and `product` are instances of a more general function called `accumulate`:
```python
def accumulate(combiner, base, n, term):
    """Return the result of combining the first n terms in a sequence and base.
    The terms to be combined are term(1), term(2), ..., term(n).  combiner is a
    two-argument commutative function.

    >>> accumulate(add, 0, 5, identity)  # 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
    15
    >>> accumulate(add, 11, 5, identity) # 11 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
    26
    >>> accumulate(add, 11, 0, identity) # 11
    11
    >>> accumulate(add, 11, 3, square)   # 11 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2
    25
    >>> accumulate(mul, 2, 3, square)    # 2 * 1^2 * 2^2 * 3^2
    72
    >>> accumulate(lambda x, y: x + y + 1, 2, 3, square)
    19
    >>> accumulate(lambda x, y: 2 * (x + y), 2, 3, square)
    58
    >>> accumulate(lambda x, y: (x + y) % 17, 19, 20, square)
    16
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```
`accumulate` has the following parameters:

`term` and `n`: the same parameters as in `summation` and `product`
`combiner`: a two-argument function that specifies how the current term is combined with the previously accumulated terms.
`base`: value at which to start the `accumulation`.
For example, the result of `accumulate(add, 11, 3, square)` is
```
11 + square(1) + square(2) + square(3) = 25
```
Note: You may assume that combiner is commutative. That is, `combiner(a, b) == combiner(b, a)` for all `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, you may not assume `combiner` is chosen from a fixed function set and hard-code the solution.
After implementing accumulate, show how summation and product can both be defined as simple calls to accumulate:
```python
def summation_using_accumulate(n, term):
    """Returns the sum of term(1) + ... + term(n). The implementation
    uses accumulate.

    >>> summation_using_accumulate(5, square)
    55
    >>> summation_using_accumulate(5, triple)
    45
    >>> from construct_check import check
    >>> # ban iteration and recursion
    >>> check(HW_SOURCE_FILE, 'summation_using_accumulate',
    ...       ['Recursion', 'For', 'While'])
    True
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

def product_using_accumulate(n, term):
    """An implementation of product using accumulate.

    >>> product_using_accumulate(4, square)
    576
    >>> product_using_accumulate(6, triple)
    524880
    >>> from construct_check import check
    >>> # ban iteration and recursion
    >>> check(HW_SOURCE_FILE, 'product_using_accumulate',
    ...       ['Recursion', 'For', 'While'])
    True
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```
Use Ok to test your code:
```bash
python3 ok -q accumulate
python3 ok -q summation_using_accumulate
python3 ok -q product_using_accumulate
```
### Q3: Make Repeater
Implement the function `make_repeater` so that `make_repeater(func, n)(x)` returns `func(func(...func(x)...))`, where `func` is applied `n` times. That is, `make_repeater(func, n)` returns another function that can then be applied to another argument. For example, `make_repeater(square, 3)(42)` evaluates to `square(square(square(42)))`.
```python
def make_repeater(func, n):
    """Return the function that computes the nth application of func.

    >>> add_three = make_repeater(increment, 3)
    >>> add_three(5)
    8
    >>> make_repeater(triple, 5)(1) # 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 1
    243
    >>> make_repeater(square, 2)(5) # square(square(5))
    625
    >>> make_repeater(square, 4)(5) # square(square(square(square(5))))
    152587890625
    >>> make_repeater(square, 0)(5) # Yes, it makes sense to apply the function zero times!
    5
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```
>For an extra challenge, try defining `make_repeater` using `compose1` and your `accumulate` function in a single one-line return statement.
```python
def compose1(func1, func2):
    """Return a function f, such that f(x) = func1(func2(x))."""
    def f(x):
        return func1(func2(x))
    return f
```
Use Ok to test your code:
```
python3 ok -q make_repeater
```

## Just for fun Question
This question is out of scope for 61a. Do it if you want an extra challenge or some practice with HOF and abstraction!
### Q4: Church numerals
The logician Alonzo Church invented a system of representing non-negative integers entirely using functions. The purpose was to show that functions are sufficient to describe all of number theory: if we have functions, we do not need to assume that numbers exist, but instead we can invent them.

Your goal in this problem is to rediscover this representation known as Church numerals. Here are the definitions of zero, as well as a function that returns one more than its argument:
```python
def zero(f):
    return lambda x: x

def successor(n):
    return lambda f: lambda x: f(n(f)(x))
```
First, define functions one and two such that they have the same behavior as successor(zero) and successsor(successor(zero)) respectively, but do not call successor in your implementation.

Next, implement a function church_to_int that converts a church numeral argument to a regular Python integer.

Finally, implement functions add_church, mul_church, and pow_church that perform addition, multiplication, and exponentiation on church numerals.
```python
def one(f):
    """Church numeral 1: same as successor(zero)"""
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

def two(f):
    """Church numeral 2: same as successor(successor(zero))"""
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

three = successor(two)

def church_to_int(n):
    """Convert the Church numeral n to a Python integer.

    >>> church_to_int(zero)
    0
    >>> church_to_int(one)
    1
    >>> church_to_int(two)
    2
    >>> church_to_int(three)
    3
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

def add_church(m, n):
    """Return the Church numeral for m + n, for Church numerals m and n.

    >>> church_to_int(add_church(two, three))
    5
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

def mul_church(m, n):
    """Return the Church numeral for m * n, for Church numerals m and n.

    >>> four = successor(three)
    >>> church_to_int(mul_church(two, three))
    6
    >>> church_to_int(mul_church(three, four))
    12
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

def pow_church(m, n):
    """Return the Church numeral m ** n, for Church numerals m and n.

    >>> church_to_int(pow_church(two, three))
    8
    >>> church_to_int(pow_church(three, two))
    9
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```
Use Ok to test your code:
```bash
python3 ok -q church_to_int
python3 ok -q add_church
python3 ok -q mul_church
python3 ok -q pow_church
```
