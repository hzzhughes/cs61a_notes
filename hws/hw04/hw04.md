## Q1: Infinite Hailstone

Write a generator function that yields the elements of the hailstone sequence starting at number `n`. After reaching the end of the hailstone sequence, the generator should yield the value 1 indefinitely.

Here's a quick reminder of how the hailstone sequence is defined:

1. Pick a positive integer `n` as the start.
2. If `n` is even, divide it by 2.
3. If `n` is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
4. Continue this process until `n` is 1.

Try to write this generator function recursively. If you're stuck, you can first try writing it iteratively and then seeing how you can turn that implementation into a recursive one.

> Hint: Since `hailstone` returns a generator, you can `yield from` a call to `hailstone`!

## Q2: Merge

Write a generator function `merge` that takes in two infinite generators `a` and `b` that are in increasing order without duplicates and returns a generator that has all the elements of both generators, in increasing order, without duplicates.

## Q3: Generate Permutations

Given a sequence of unique elements, a permutation of the sequence is a list containing the elements of the sequence in some arbitrary order. For example, `[2, 1, 3]`, `[1, 3, 2]`, and `[3, 2, 1]` are some of the permutations of the sequence `[1, 2, 3]`.

Implement `perms`, a generator function that takes in a sequence `seq` and returns a generator that yields all permutations of `seq`. For this question, assume that `seq` will not be empty.

Permutations may be yielded in any order. Note that the doctests test whether you are yielding all possible permutations, but not in any particular order. The built-in `sorted` function takes in an iterable object and returns a list containing the elements of the iterable in non-decreasing order.

>*Hint*: If you had the permutations of all but one of the elements in `seq`, how could you use that to generate the permutations of the full `seq`? For example, you can use `perms([1,2])` to generate permutations for `perms([1,2,3])`:

Try drawing a similar diagram for `perms([1,2,3,4])`.

>*Hint*: Remember, it's possible to loop over generator objects because generators are iterators!
